# Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio
Here is where I list the relevant projects that I have worked on as a data analyst, while telling the skills that I have acquired after working on them.
## [1. The Cyclistic BikeShare project (For my Google Data Analytics Certificate)]("https://www.kaggle.com/code/eliedjani/cyclistic-bikeshare-project")
### Used R for Analysis, Cleanning, Exploring and plotting.
Dived into the cyclistic data and found insight, presented my findings using a story and profided recommendations to cyclistic Bikeshare.
